	- schedule time to work on your assignments.  (they shouldn't take more than 10 hours for most)
	- schedule time on your schedule to attend @ least 2 office hours/week (note that offices
    hours on Wednesdays and Thursdays are busy).
	- budget the same thing for other classes
  - build in some extra time in case your work takes longer than expected
  - if you finish any of your scheduled tasks and you have time left, that's time you have to spend how you want
  - put in some free time for things you find fun. 
  - if your schedule seems very full, make sure you have enough time to eat, sleep, and talk to people
- Build study groups of 2 different sets of people.

Tools to stay on task:
These tools do things like reward you points for not being on your phone in class, and give you other
incentives to stay focused. 
- PocketPoints: app where you can get free stuff/discounts for staying off your phone during class
- Forest: useful when studying. Grows a tree while you keep off your phone. if you use your phone, the tree dies.  
- Distraction Blockers on the internet such as Self-Control, StayFocused, FocusBooster


Some Study Techniques
These are not one size fits all. Some of these strategies may work from you, and some may not. 
Feel free to try multiple and see what's effective for your study style. 

- Focus on a task for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break (Pomodoro Technique)
- If you're having a hard time starting on a task, spend 10 minutes working on a task, then decide
	if you want to continue working or not. Most of the time, you'll continue working
- Set a goal to complete 80% of your task, not the entire thing
- Set a SMART goal for the week. Smart stands for Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, Time-Bound. 
	Make sure you describe your goal, you can measure if you succeeded/the degree to which you succeeded, 
	you must complete an action or set of actions to accomplish the goal, the goal is feasable to accomplish, 
	and you set a time period to complete the goal
	These can last for a day, a week, a month, a semester, or longer depending on the nature of the goal. 
	For example: "I want to study 4 times a week, for an hour, for the next month in order to get an A on my final 
	on December 14th."
	"Tonight, I will work on Chemistry for 2 hours to finish my homework, take a dinner break, then work on my CS312 Assignment for
	2 hours."
	A goal like "I want to get an A in CS312" doesn't tell you what you need to do to achieve the goal.
