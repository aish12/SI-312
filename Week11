A. What is row major order?

B. Suppose you have a matrix that looks like this:
Data: 
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 0 1 2

This matrix is  represented in java. What will this evaluate to?
System.out.println(data[0])

What do you want it to print out?

1. Write a print method for a 2d array.

1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6, 7, 8
9, 0, 1, 2

2, Write a method that takes in a 2d array. And returns a single array with the max value of each row.
For the example above, we return [4, 8, 9]

3. Change the previous method so it returns the max of each COLUMN. 
Example returns [9, 6, 7, 8]

4. Suppose you are given a 3x3 matrix that simulates a tic tac toe board. Write a method that 
determines whether player X or O has won the game. If neither has won, indicate that with your choice of return value. 

5. Given an array with n-1 elements, the array has numbers 1 to n, but is missing a number. What is the missing number? 

6. Given an array, find the top 2 values in the array.
