1.	What is the purpose of methods?
2.	Is there any downside to putting everything in main vs. using methods? Explain your reasoning.
3.	Which of the following method names are valid
  a.	I_Ate_Some_Pie
  b.	I-Ate-Some-Pie
  c.	1AteSomePie
  d.	_IAteSomePie
  e.	void
  f.	publicStaticVoidMain
  g.	publicStaticVoidMain23
  h.	23publicStaticVoidMain
  i.	String
  j.  int
4.	Expressions:
  a.	4 + 5 % 3 * 4 -5
  b.	4 * (2 + 4) – 3 * 5
  c.	54 % 10 + 8 * 3 % 9
  d.	3 * 2 + 4 + “+” + 2 + 3 * 4
  e.	2.3 * 3 + 19 / 5 / 2 + 6.0 / 5
5.	Write a program that prints out “Welcome to SI!” 27 times. Make sure you use methods to make 
your code less redundant: i.e do not print out “Welcome to SI” with 27 println statements.
6. Write a program that prints out 81 lines. Let "n" be the line you are currently printing out.
In each line, print out 16 stars, then print out "n" number of exclamations..
7.	Write a function that calculates the area of a circle. Print out that value. Use 
a variable for values that could possibly change. (Area = pi*r^2)
